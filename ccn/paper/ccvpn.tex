\begin{abstract}
Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a future Internet architecture which is envisioned as
an alternative to the current IP-based model. CCN emphasizes content distribution by making
contents directly addressable in a request-based information centric network. An advantage
of CCN is that it has some innate privacy friendly features, such as lack of source and
destination addresses in packets. However, to be considered a viable future Internet
architecture, CCN must offer services for private and anonymous communication that are
at least equivalent to those present in the IP architecture. Among such, VPNs are a very
popular application that enables users to send and receive data across shared or public
networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the same private
network. In this work we design, implement and evaluate CCVPN, a content centric
virtual private network capable of providing the same functionality of VPNs within
the CCN Internet architecture. To the best of our knowledge CCVPN is the first proposal
of a VPN alike service for CCNs. In addition to the CCVPN design, we also provide a
security analysis and experimental performance evaluation for this new system.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented the design, implementation, and assessment of CCVPN, a scheme and
protocol for building secure and private tunnels in CCN. CCVPN allows two namespaces
to be bridged by a tunnel across a public network. Unlike point-to-point tunnels,
such as those enabled by secure session protocols, CCVPN allows many consumers
to share the tunnel to access the private namespace. CCVPN is designed with efficiency
in mind: public-key cryptographic operations are kept to a minimum during normal
operation; symmetric-key packet encapsulation algorithms are used to marshall
packets between gateways. Our experimental evidence indicate that CCVPN offers
modest performance in the presence of a variable number of consumers and producers.
The results suggest that CCVPN could be deployed for private namespace tunneling
in real world CCN deployments.

For future work, we plan to implement the CCNxKE protocol from~\cite{ccnxke} as a
way to bootstrap symmetric-key tunnels in CCVPN. We will also integrate CCVPN into
real world testbeds to assess its performance for real-world applications. These
include video streaming and large-scale content dissemination applications. Finally,
we plan to investigate countermeasures to DoS attacks on CCVPN, such as puzzles for tunnel establishment.
